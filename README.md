# Techtron

## Overview
Techtron is a modern e-commerce platform designed to offer users a seamless shopping experience. 
Originally built using Vue.js and PHP, the application has been transformed to utilize Vue.js in conjunction with Supabase, a powerful backend-as-a-service platform. 
This transition enhances the application's scalability, performance, and real-time capabilities.
